	    <p>Founded in 2013, Rankings.io was purpose-built with one goal in mind: delivering exceptional results for attorneys without compromising on customer service. While SEO was a growing field at the time of Rankings‚Äô inception, very few companies specialized in <strong>SEO for attorneys and law firms</strong>. <br><br>As a result, Chris Dreyer‚Äôs nascent agency found itself operating within a relatively small pool, but against others who were just as hungry to grow as he was. We all know that the legal profession not only attracts, but also tests some of the most competitive people in our society. After all, it‚Äôs a business in which (much of the time) there can be only one winner. The parallels between the legal vertical and legal SEO were not lost on Chris. Rankings sharpened its edge and, within a few years, found its greatest successes in possibly the most cutthroat of all niches: marketing for personal injury law firms. <br><br>As a result, in 2018, Rankings niched down further and made personal injury SEO their sole focus. If Rankings‚Äô previously competitive niche had been like swimming with piranhas in a very small pool, moving to only working with personal injury attorneys was like the proverbial knife fight in a phone booth: fast-paced, dangerous, and with precious little margin for error. In the past six years of exclusively serving personal injury law firms, Rankings has honed their skills to a razor finish. <br><br>They have taken on clients in some of the most ruthless markets in the country, and they‚Äôve produced results there that make the phrase ‚Äúreturn on investment‚Äù seem simply an inadequate description. As Rankings moves into its second decade in operation, it is opening its doors once again to prospective clients in all areas of the legal field.

We've authored and executed strategies for companies from the bootstrapped solopreneurs to the Series B power-houses that become dominant in their niche. And we love to share our knowledge.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">If you've mostly worked with SEO agencies and content marketers that primarily understand views and traffic, but not leads and revenue, then you may be in the right place.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">RevenueZen works deeply across sales and marketing teams, using the power of organic across your website and your executive LinkedIn profiles to drive brand awareness that results in more trusted inbound leads every month.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">We believe that inbound marketing campaigns produce valueable brand assets that you owe it to yourself to build up over time, yielding steady streams of leads for you to close. We operate at the intersection of:</p>
<ul class=""hidden"">
<li>Powerful forward-looking SEO</li>
<li>High-quality content that both your readers and Google will love</li>
<li>Compelling executive thought leadership on Linkedin</li>
<li>Outbound lead generation and distribution techniques that your average content marketers or SEO consultant has never learned about</li>
</ul>
<p class=""hidden"">Having led growth marketing, SEO, content, and sales development teams for 200+ companies, we work with our clients as fractional revenue advisors and leaders, not as order-takers.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">If you want an agency to nod their heads and take your orders, then that's not us. If you'd prefer to get pushback on your ideas and work with people who stand firm on what they believe will work best for you, then we look forward to contributing to your 2022 growth and lead generation strategy.</p>

<p>Back in 2008, the economic recession dealt crushing blows to small business owners everywhere.</p>

<p>Among those businesses affected were New Life Rockeries (owned and operated by Neil Eneix Sr.) Left with crippling debt and difficult choices, things seemed grim for the small landscaping business.</p>

<p class=""hidden"">In an effort to help their family recover financially, his two oldest sons Keith and Neil Eneix began a small SEO company to help provide financial relief for the family.</p>

<p class=""hidden"">Experiencing success through hard work, passion, and smarter marketing &amp; sales systems Neil Eneix Sr was able to pull B&amp;D Rockeries back into the green (no landscaping pun intended) and plant the seed that ultimately grew into our full-services marketing agency, Fannit!&nbsp;</p>

	    <p>Founded in 2013, Rankings.io was purpose-built with one goal in mind: delivering exceptional results for attorneys without compromising on customer service. While SEO was a growing field at the time of Rankings‚Äô inception, very few companies specialized in <strong>SEO for attorneys and law firms</strong>. <br><br>As a result, Chris Dreyer‚Äôs nascent agency found itself operating within a relatively small pool, but against others who were just as hungry to grow as he was. We all know that the legal profession not only attracts, but also tests some of the most competitive people in our society. After all, it‚Äôs a business in which (much of the time) there can be only one winner. The parallels between the legal vertical and legal SEO were not lost on Chris. Rankings sharpened its edge and, within a few years, found its greatest successes in possibly the most cutthroat of all niches: marketing for personal injury law firms. <br><br>As a result, in 2018, Rankings niched down further and made personal injury SEO their sole focus. If Rankings‚Äô previously competitive niche had been like swimming with piranhas in a very small pool, moving to only working with personal injury attorneys was like the proverbial knife fight in a phone booth: fast-paced, dangerous, and with precious little margin for error. In the past six years of exclusively serving personal injury law firms, Rankings has honed their skills to a razor finish. <br><br>They have taken on clients in some of the most ruthless markets in the country, and they‚Äôve produced results there that make the phrase ‚Äúreturn on investment‚Äù seem simply an inadequate description. As Rankings moves into its second decade in operation, it is opening its doors once again to prospective clients in all areas of the legal field. Soon, firms in every practice area will learn what personal injury lawyers already know: We are Rankings.io. We play the game to win. </p><button type=""button"" id=""read_more"" class=""read-more"" aria-label=""Summary Read More"">Read more...</button>

	    <p>Founded in 2013, Rankings.io was purpose-built with one goal in mind: delivering exceptional results for attorneys without compromising on customer service. While SEO was a growing field at the time of Rankings‚Äô inception, very few companies specialized in <strong>SEO for attorneys and law firms</strong>. <br><br>As a result, Chris Dreyer‚Äôs nascent agency found itself operating within a relatively small pool, but against others who were just as hungry to grow as he was. We all know that the legal profession not only attracts, but also tests some of the most competitive people in our society. After all, it‚Äôs a business in which (much of the time) there can be only one winner. The parallels between the legal vertical and legal SEO were not lost on Chris. Rankings sharpened its edge and, within a few years, found its greatest successes in possibly the most cutthroat of all niches: marketing for personal injury law firms. <br><br>As a result, in 2018, Rankings niched down further and made personal injury SEO their sole focus. If Rankings‚Äô previously competitive niche had been like swimming with piranhas in a very small pool, moving to only working with personal injury attorneys was like the proverbial knife fight in a phone booth: fast-paced, dangerous, and with precious little margin for error. In the past six years of exclusively serving personal injury law firms, Rankings has honed their skills to a razor finish. <br><br>They have taken on clients in some of the most ruthless markets in the country, and they‚Äôve produced results there that make the phrase ‚Äúreturn on investment‚Äù seem simply an inadequate description. As Rankings moves into its second decade in operation, it is opening its doors once again to prospective clients in all areas of the legal field. Soon, firms in every practice area will learn what personal injury lawyers already know: We are Rankings.io. We play the game to win. </p><button type=""button"" id=""read_more"" class=""read-more"" aria-label=""Summary Read More"">Read more...</button>

We've authored and executed strategies for companies from the bootstrapped solopreneurs to the Series B power-houses that become dominant in their niche. And we love to share our knowledge.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">If you've mostly worked with SEO agencies and content marketers that primarily understand views and traffic, but not leads and revenue, then you may be in the right place.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">RevenueZen works deeply across sales and marketing teams, using the power of organic across your website and your executive LinkedIn profiles to drive brand awareness that results in more trusted inbound leads every month.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">We believe that inbound marketing campaigns produce valueable brand assets that you owe it to yourself to build up over time, yielding steady streams of leads for you to close. We operate at the intersection of:</p>
<ul class=""hidden"">
<li>Powerful forward-looking SEO</li>
<li>High-quality content that both your readers and Google will love</li>
<li>Compelling executive thought leadership on Linkedin</li>
<li>Outbound lead generation and distribution techniques that your average content marketers or SEO consultant has never learned about</li>
</ul>
<p class=""hidden"">Having led growth marketing, SEO, content, and sales development teams for 200+ companies, we work with our clients as fractional revenue advisors and leaders, not as order-takers.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">If you want an agency to nod their heads and take your orders, then that's not us. If you'd prefer to get pushback on your ideas and work with people who stand firm on what they believe will work best for you, then we look forward to contributing to your 2022 growth and lead generation strategy.</p>

	    <p>SeoProfy is a <strong>digital marketing agency</strong> with a focus on search engine optimization based on an advanced <strong>data-driven SEO</strong> approach.</p>
<p>Every SEO agency promises the same thing:&nbsp;</p>
<p>- More traffic</p>
<p>- More leads</p>
<p>- More sales</p>
<p>Not us. At <strong>SeoProfy</strong>, we don‚Äôt make a bunch of empty promises and broadcast them to the interwebs. We only make promises we can keep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why we always start with a thorough SEO audit ‚Äì and only *then* tell you what‚Äôs doable.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""hidden""><strong>If we aren‚Äôt confident that we can get you a *massive* return on investment, we won‚Äôt take on your project.</strong> It‚Äôs that simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""hidden"">If we start working together, we won‚Äôt just assign you a few random SEO specialists from our team. No, no. We‚Äôll go out and <strong>find the best SEO experts</strong> for your project ‚Äì and they‚Äôll work for you (and only you) full time.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""hidden"">But VIP treatment is just one of many reasons why you‚Äôll love working with us. Our keen eye for detail is another.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""hidden"">Because we focus exclusively on SEO, we‚Äôre able to dig *much* deeper than your typical do-it-all marketing agency.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""hidden"">Rather than just look at things like keywords, backlinks and site speed, we <strong>analyze all the little details</strong> that many other agencies ignore (the ones that could make a HUGE difference in your traffic‚Ä¶ and ROI).&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""hidden"">We even <strong>created our own SEO tools</strong>. To accomplish the things that we can‚Äôt do with traditional SEO tools like Ahrefs and Screaming Frogs.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">Scroll down to see how we got those results ‚Äì and why our clients rave about us.&nbsp;</p><button type=""button"" id=""read_more"" class=""read-more"" aria-label=""Summary Read More"">Read more...</button>

<p>OUR PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p class=""hidden"">We take an analytics-based approach to digital execution and are known for producing relevant brand experiences while also delivering the evidence to back up our successes. Our results-proven mix of cross-channel marketing, audience-centric creative, and data-backed strategies focuses on engagement and presents new opportunities well beyond the traditional days of impressions-driven programmatic and mass media buys.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">HOW WE WORK</p>
<p class=""hidden"">Most firms operate as virtual factories, where managers juggle dozens of accounts every day, resulting in a lose-lose situation: you're not satisfied in the end, and we don't foster a relationship we're proud to stand by.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">Each strategist is assigned a small handful of accounts, becoming an expert in every aspect of your business and market movements. The work we do is labor-intensive, communication-intensive, and incredibly dynamic. Overloading our teams would render success impossible.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">Preserving this service model requires us to be pragmatic in choosing client partners. We will objectively analyze your business, goals, and budget well before we negotiate terms. If we determine we can‚Äôt add value to your business or our methodology isn‚Äôt a good fit, we'll be honest about it. Consequently, should you choose us as your digital partner, you can be confident in our ability to deliver the results we promise.</p><button type=""button"" id=""read_more"" class=""read-more"" aria-label=""Summary Read More"">Read more...</button>

	    <p>Founded in 2013, Rankings.io was purpose-built with one goal in mind: delivering exceptional results for attorneys without compromising on customer service. While SEO was a growing field at the time of Rankings‚Äô inception, very few companies specialized in <strong>SEO for attorneys and law firms</strong>. <br><br>As a result, Chris Dreyer‚Äôs nascent agency found itself operating within a relatively small pool, but against others who were just as hungry to grow as he was. We all know that the legal profession not only attracts, but also tests some of the most competitive people in our society. After all, it‚Äôs a business in which (much of the time) there can be only one winner. The parallels between the legal vertical and legal SEO were not lost on Chris. Rankings sharpened its edge and, within a few years, found its greatest successes in possibly the most cutthroat of all niches: marketing for personal injury law firms. <br><br>As a result, in 2018, Rankings niched down further and made personal injury SEO their sole focus. If Rankings‚Äô previously competitive niche had been like swimming with piranhas in a very small pool, moving to only working with personal injury attorneys was like the proverbial knife fight in a phone booth: fast-paced, dangerous, and with precious little margin for error. In the past six years of exclusively serving personal injury law firms, Rankings has honed their skills to a razor finish. <br><br>They have taken on clients in some of the most ruthless markets in the country, and they‚Äôve produced results there that make the phrase ‚Äúreturn on investment‚Äù seem simply an inadequate description. As Rankings moves into its second decade in operation, it is opening its doors once again to prospective clients in all areas of the legal field. Soon, firms in every practice area will learn what personal injury lawyers already know: We are Rankings.io. We play the game to win. </p><button type=""button"" id=""read_more"" class=""read-more"" aria-label=""Summary Read More"">Read more...</button>

	    <p>Wondering what successful venture-backed B2B SaaS and established professional service brands are doing to grow with inbound marketing? Talk to us! We've authored and executed strategies for companies from the bootstrapped solopreneurs to the Series B power-houses that become dominant in their niche. And we love to share our knowledge.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">If you've mostly worked with SEO agencies and content marketers that primarily understand views and traffic, but not leads and revenue, then you may be in the right place.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">RevenueZen works deeply across sales and marketing teams, using the power of organic across your website and your executive LinkedIn profiles to drive brand awareness that results in more trusted inbound leads every month.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">We believe that inbound marketing campaigns produce valueable brand assets that you owe it to yourself to build up over time, yielding steady streams of leads for you to close. We operate at the intersection of:</p>
<ul class=""hidden"">
<li>Powerful forward-looking SEO</li>
<li>High-quality content that both your readers and Google will love</li>
<li>Compelling executive thought leadership on Linkedin</li>
<li>Outbound lead generation and distribution techniques that your average content marketers or SEO consultant has never learned about</li>
</ul>
<p class=""hidden"">Having led growth marketing, SEO, content, and sales development teams for 200+ companies, we work with our clients as fractional revenue advisors and leaders, not as order-takers.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">If you want an agency to nod their heads and take your orders, then that's not us. If you'd prefer to get pushback on your ideas and work with people who stand firm on what they believe will work best for you, then we look forward to contributing to your 2022 growth and lead generation strategy.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">How we helpd one B2B SaaS company over 10X its flow of visitors and dramatically amp up its lead flow, within a year: <a rel=""nofollow"">https://revenuezen.com/inbound-marketing-case-study .</a></p>

	    <p>Digital marketing in this day and age can be dry. Rigid. Mechanical. And listen, we look forward to the inevitable robot overlords as much as the next agency (we say that just in case they're listening), but the reality is, marketing is about people talking to people. It's about knowing what excites the customer, and what drives them; it's about synergizing with their own story.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">We are all writing our own stories. We have clients that have gone from being blackmailed into re-signing contracts by crooked agencies (true story), to signing with us instead and growing their revenue by triple-digits (also true story!). We have clients that have started as small 2-person startups and evolved with us into sustainable, fully-staffed eCommerce businesses. Our average client stays with us for 3.5 years, and we think that says it all. Our team is full of passionate, dedicated, unique individuals, and we can't be more proud of that.</p>

	    <p>Founded in 2013, Rankings.io was purpose-built with one goal in mind: delivering exceptional results for attorneys without compromising on customer service. While SEO was a growing field at the time of Rankings‚Äô inception, very few companies specialized in <strong>SEO for attorneys and law firms</strong>. <br><br>As a result, Chris Dreyer‚Äôs nascent agency found itself operating within a relatively small pool, but against others who were just as hungry to grow as he was. We all know that the legal profession not only attracts, but also tests some of the most competitive people in our society. After all, it‚Äôs a business in which (much of the time) there can be only one winner. The parallels between the legal vertical and legal SEO were not lost on Chris. Rankings sharpened its edge and, within a few years, found its greatest successes in possibly the most cutthroat of all niches: marketing for personal injury law firms. <br><br>As a result, in 2018, Rankings niched down further and made personal injury SEO their sole focus. If Rankings‚Äô previously competitive niche had been like swimming with piranhas in a very small pool, moving to only working with personal injury attorneys was like the proverbial knife fight in a phone booth: fast-paced, dangerous, and with precious little margin for error. In the past six years of exclusively serving personal injury law firms, Rankings has honed their skills to a razor finish. <br><br>They have taken on clients in some of the most ruthless markets in the country, and they‚Äôve produced results there that make the phrase ‚Äúreturn on investment‚Äù seem simply an inadequate description. As Rankings moves into its second decade in operation, it is opening its doors once again to prospective clients in all areas of the legal field. Soon, firms in every practice area will learn what personal injury lawyers already know: We are Rankings.io. We play the game to win. </p><button type=""button"" id=""read_more"" class=""read-more"" aria-label=""Summary Read More"">Read more...</button>

	    <p>Wondering what successful venture-backed B2B SaaS and established professional service brands are doing to grow with inbound marketing? Talk to us! We've authored and executed strategies for companies from the bootstrapped solopreneurs to the Series B power-houses that become dominant in their niche. And we love to share our knowledge.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">If you've mostly worked with SEO agencies and content marketers that primarily understand views and traffic, but not leads and revenue, then you may be in the right place.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">RevenueZen works deeply across sales and marketing teams, using the power of organic across your website and your executive LinkedIn profiles to drive brand awareness that results in more trusted inbound leads every month.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">We believe that inbound marketing campaigns produce valueable brand assets that you owe it to yourself to build up over time, yielding steady streams of leads for you to close. We operate at the intersection of:</p>
<ul class=""hidden"">
<li>Powerful forward-looking SEO</li>
<li>High-quality content that both your readers and Google will love</li>
<li>Compelling executive thought leadership on Linkedin</li>
<li>Outbound lead generation and distribution techniques that your average content marketers or SEO consultant has never learned about</li>
</ul>
<p class=""hidden"">Having led growth marketing, SEO, content, and sales development teams for 200+ companies, we work with our clients as fractional revenue advisors and leaders, not as order-takers.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">If you want an agency to nod their heads and take your orders, then that's not us. If you'd prefer to get pushback on your ideas and work with people who stand firm on what they believe will work best for you, then we look forward to contributing to your 2022 growth and lead generation strategy.</p>

	    <p>Founded in 2013, Rankings.io was purpose-built with one goal in mind: delivering exceptional results for attorneys without compromising on customer service. While SEO was a growing field at the time of Rankings‚Äô inception, very few companies specialized in <strong>SEO for attorneys and law firms</strong>. <br><br>As a result, Chris Dreyer‚Äôs nascent agency found itself operating within a relatively small pool, but against others who were just as hungry to grow as he was. We all know that the legal profession not only attracts, but also tests some of the most competitive people in our society. After all, it‚Äôs a business in which (much of the time) there can be only one winner. The parallels between the legal vertical and legal SEO were not lost on Chris. Rankings sharpened its edge and, within a few years, found its greatest successes in possibly the most cutthroat of all niches: marketing for personal injury law firms. <br><br>As a result, in 2018, Rankings niched down further and made personal injury SEO their sole focus. If Rankings‚Äô previously competitive niche had been like swimming with piranhas in a very small pool, moving to only working with personal injury attorneys was like the proverbial knife fight in a phone booth: fast-paced, dangerous, and with precious little margin for error. In the past six years of exclusively serving personal injury law firms, Rankings has honed their skills to a razor finish. <br><br>They have taken on clients in some of the most ruthless markets in the country, and they‚Äôve produced results there that make the phrase ‚Äúreturn on investment‚Äù seem simply an inadequate description. As Rankings moves into its second decade in operation, it is opening its doors once again to prospective clients in all areas of the legal field. Soon, firms in every practice area will learn what personal injury lawyers already know: We are Rankings.io. We play the game to win. </p><button type=""button"" id=""read_more"" class=""read-more"" aria-label=""Summary Read More"">Read more...</button>

	    <p>Wondering what successful venture-backed B2B SaaS and established professional service brands are doing to grow with inbound marketing? Talk to us! We've authored and executed strategies for companies from the bootstrapped solopreneurs to the Series B power-houses that become dominant in their niche. And we love to share our knowledge.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">If you've mostly worked with SEO agencies and content marketers that primarily understand views and traffic, but not leads and revenue, then you may be in the right place.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">RevenueZen works deeply across sales and marketing teams, using the power of organic across your website and your executive LinkedIn profiles to drive brand awareness that results in more trusted inbound leads every month.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">We believe that inbound marketing campaigns produce valueable brand assets that you owe it to yourself to build up over time, yielding steady streams of leads for you to close. We operate at the intersection of:</p>
<ul class=""hidden"">
<li>Powerful forward-looking SEO</li>
<li>High-quality content that both your readers and Google will love</li>
<li>Compelling executive thought leadership on Linkedin</li>
<li>Outbound lead generation and distribution techniques that your average content marketers or SEO consultant has never learned about</li>
</ul>
<p class=""hidden"">Having led growth marketing, SEO, content, and sales development teams for 200+ companies, we work with our clients as fractional revenue advisors and leaders, not as order-takers.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">If you want an agency to nod their heads and take your orders, then that's not us. If you'd prefer to get pushback on your ideas and work with people who stand firm on what they believe will work best for you, then we look forward to contributing to your 2022 growth and lead generation strategy.</p>

	    <p>Founded in 2013, Rankings.io was purpose-built with one goal in mind: delivering exceptional results for attorneys without compromising on customer service. While SEO was a growing field at the time of Rankings‚Äô inception, very few companies specialized in <strong>SEO for attorneys and law firms</strong>. <br><br>As a result, Chris Dreyer‚Äôs nascent agency found itself operating within a relatively small pool, but against others who were just as hungry to grow as he was. We all know that the legal profession not only attracts, but also tests some of the most competitive people in our society. After all, it‚Äôs a business in which (much of the time) there can be only one winner. The parallels between the legal vertical and legal SEO were not lost on Chris. Rankings sharpened its edge and, within a few years, found its greatest successes in possibly the most cutthroat of all niches: marketing for personal injury law firms. <br><br>As a result, in 2018, Rankings niched down further and made personal injury SEO their sole focus. If Rankings‚Äô previously competitive niche had been like swimming with piranhas in a very small pool, moving to only working with personal injury attorneys was like the proverbial knife fight in a phone booth: fast-paced, dangerous, and with precious little margin for error. In the past six years of exclusively serving personal injury law firms, Rankings has honed their skills to a razor finish. <br><br>They have taken on clients in some of the most ruthless markets in the country, and they‚Äôve produced results there that make the phrase ‚Äúreturn on investment‚Äù seem simply an inadequate description. As Rankings moves into its second decade in operation, it is opening its doors once again to prospective clients in all areas of the legal field. Soon, firms in every practice area will learn what personal injury lawyers already know: We are Rankings.io. We play the game to win. </p><button type=""button"" id=""read_more"" class=""read-more"" aria-label=""Summary Read More"">Read more...</button>

	    <p>Wondering what successful venture-backed B2B SaaS and established professional service brands are doing to grow with inbound marketing? Talk to us! We've authored and executed strategies for companies from the bootstrapped solopreneurs to the Series B power-houses that become dominant in their niche. And we love to share our knowledge.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">If you've mostly worked with SEO agencies and content marketers that primarily understand views and traffic, but not leads and revenue, then you may be in the right place.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">RevenueZen works deeply across sales and marketing teams, using the power of organic across your website and your executive LinkedIn profiles to drive brand awareness that results in more trusted inbound leads every month.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">We believe that inbound marketing campaigns produce valueable brand assets that you owe it to yourself to build up over time, yielding steady streams of leads for you to close. We operate at the intersection of:</p>
<ul class=""hidden"">
<li>Powerful forward-looking SEO</li>
<li>High-quality content that both your readers and Google will love</li>
<li>Compelling executive thought leadership on Linkedin</li>
<li>Outbound lead generation and distribution techniques that your average content marketers or SEO consultant has never learned about</li>
</ul>
<p class=""hidden"">Having led growth marketing, SEO, content, and sales development teams for 200+ companies, we work with our clients as fractional revenue advisors and leaders, not as order-takers.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">If you want an agency to nod their heads and take your orders, then that's not us. If you'd prefer to get pushback on your ideas and work with people who stand firm on what they believe will work best for you, then we look forward to contributing to your 2022 growth and lead generation strategy.</p>

	    <p>Founded in 2013, Rankings.io was purpose-built with one goal in mind: delivering exceptional results for attorneys without compromising on customer service. While SEO was a growing field at the time of Rankings‚Äô inception, very few companies specialized in <strong>SEO for attorneys and law firms</strong>. <br><br>As a result, Chris Dreyer‚Äôs nascent agency found itself operating within a relatively small pool, but against others who were just as hungry to grow as he was. We all know that the legal profession not only attracts, but also tests some of the most competitive people in our society. After all, it‚Äôs a business in which (much of the time) there can be only one winner. The parallels between the legal vertical and legal SEO were not lost on Chris. Rankings sharpened its edge and, within a few years, found its greatest successes in possibly the most cutthroat of all niches: marketing for personal injury law firms. <br><br>As a result, in 2018, Rankings niched down further and made personal injury SEO their sole focus. If Rankings‚Äô previously competitive niche had been like swimming with piranhas in a very small pool, moving to only working with personal injury attorneys was like the proverbial knife fight in a phone booth: fast-paced, dangerous, and with precious little margin for error. In the past six years of exclusively serving personal injury law firms, Rankings has honed their skills to a razor finish. <br><br>They have taken on clients in some of the most ruthless markets in the country, and they‚Äôve produced results there that make the phrase ‚Äúreturn on investment‚Äù seem simply an inadequate description. As Rankings moves into its second decade in operation, it is opening its doors once again to prospective clients in all areas of the legal field. Soon, firms in every practice area will learn what personal injury lawyers already know: We are Rankings.io. We play the game to win. </p><button type=""button"" id=""read_more"" class=""read-more"" aria-label=""Summary Read More"">Read more...</button>

	    <p>Wondering what successful venture-backed B2B SaaS and established professional service brands are doing to grow with inbound marketing? Talk to us! We've authored and executed strategies for companies from the bootstrapped solopreneurs to the Series B power-houses that become dominant in their niche. And we love to share our knowledge.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">If you've mostly worked with SEO agencies and content marketers that primarily understand views and traffic, but not leads and revenue, then you may be in the right place.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">RevenueZen works deeply across sales and marketing teams, using the power of organic across your website and your executive LinkedIn profiles to drive brand awareness that results in more trusted inbound leads every month.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">We believe that inbound marketing campaigns produce valueable brand assets that you owe it to yourself to build up over time, yielding steady streams of leads for you to close. We operate at the intersection of:</p>
<ul class=""hidden"">
<li>Powerful forward-looking SEO</li>
<li>High-quality content that both your readers and Google will love</li>
<li>Compelling executive thought leadership on Linkedin</li>
<li>Outbound lead generation and distribution techniques that your average content marketers or SEO consultant has never learned about</li>
</ul>
<p class=""hidden"">Having led growth marketing, SEO, content, and sales development teams for 200+ companies, we work with our clients as fractional revenue advisors and leaders, not as order-takers.</p>
<p class=""hidden"">If you want an agency to nod their heads and take your orders, then that's not us. If you'd prefer to get pushback on your ideas and work with people who stand firm on what they believe will work best for you, then we look forward to contributing to your 2022 growth and lead generation strategy.</p>
